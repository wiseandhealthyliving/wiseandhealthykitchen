                            <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3"><i class="bi bi-heart-pulse me-2"></i>Our Commitment to You</h5>
                            <p class="mb-0">At Wise & Healthy Kitchen, your family's health comes first. We only recommend products we've thoroughly researched and genuinely believe are safer for your home. Our affiliate relationships never compromise our commitment to providing honest, evidence-based information.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">What is Affiliate Marketing?</h2>
                        <p>Affiliate marketing is a common practice where websites earn a commission by linking to products sold by retailers. When you click on a product link from our website and make a purchase, we may receive a small percentage of that sale as compensation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> This commission comes from the retailer's marketing budget, not from you. You pay the same price whether you click our link or go directly to the retailer's website.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">Amazon Associates Program</h2>
                        
                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">Program Participation</h3>
                        <p>Wise & Healthy Kitchen is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">How It Works</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Product Links:</strong> When you see product links or "View on Amazon" buttons on our website, these are affiliate links</li>
                            <li><strong>Commission Earned:</strong> If you click these links and make a purchase within 24 hours, we earn a small commission (typically 1-10% depending on the product category)</li>
                            <li><strong>Your Cost:</strong> You pay exactly the same price as if you went directly to Amazon</li>
                            <li><strong>What We Earn:</strong> The commission helps us cover website costs and continue providing free, high-quality content</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">Amazon's 24-Hour Cookie</h3>
                        <p>When you click one of our Amazon affiliate links, Amazon places a cookie in your browser that lasts for 24 hours. This means:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We earn a commission on ANY items you purchase within 24 hours, not just the item we linked to</li>
                            <li>You don't need to complete your purchase immediately</li>
                            <li>The cookie expires after 24 hours or when you click another affiliate link</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">Our Editorial Independence</h2>
                        
                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">How We Choose Products to Recommend</h3>
                        <p>Our product recommendations are based solely on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Materials used, certifications, absence of harmful chemicals (BPA, PFAS, etc.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Build quality, durability, warranty coverage</li>
                            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Thorough investigation of product specifications and safety claims</li>
                            <li><strong>Real Testing:</strong> When possible, hands-on testing or analysis of verified user experiences</li>
                            <li><strong>Value:</strong> Whether the product offers good value for its price point</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4 mb-3">What Does NOT Influence Our Recommendations</h3>
                        <p>We do NOT base our recommendations on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>❌ Commission rates (we recommend products even if they pay lower commissions)</li>
                            <li>❌ Manufacturer payments or sponsorships (we don't accept payment for reviews)</li>
                            <li>❌ Free products from manufacturers (we maintain editorial independence)</li>
                            <li>❌ Relationships with brands (our loyalty is to YOU, not brands)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="alert alert-info mt-4 mb-4">
                            <p class="mb-0"><strong>Our Promise:</strong> If we wouldn't use a product in our own homes or recommend it to our families, we won't recommend it to you—regardless of commission potential.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">Other Affiliate Relationships</h2>
                        <p>While Amazon Associates is our primary affiliate program, we may participate in other affiliate programs in the future. If we do, we will:</p>

                            <li>Clearly disclose all affiliate relationships</li>
                            <li>Maintain the same high standards for product recommendations</li>
                            <li>Update this disclosure page accordingly</li>
                        </ul>
